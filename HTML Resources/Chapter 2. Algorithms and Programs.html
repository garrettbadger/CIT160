<h2>Chapter 2. Algorithms and Programs</h2>

<h3 id="ch2outcomes">Chapter Outcomes</h3>
<p>By the end of this chapter, you will:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Read a description of a problem and write a defining table to
	help you better understand the problem.</li>
	<li>Develop an algorithm for a common task.</li>
	<li>Learn the three basic control structures: sequence, selection,
	and repetition, and learn what they cause a computer to do.</li>
	<li>Understand the basic operations that a computer can perform.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="ch2define">Defining Table</h3>
<p>An <dfn>algorithm</dfn> is simply a list of steps to perform some
task. A large computer program contains many algorithms. Before creating
an algorithm to solve a problem, you must be sure that you understand
the problem. If you don’t, you will probably create an algorithm
that solves the wrong problem. A <dfn>defining table</dfn> is a useful
tool to help you better understand a problem before you develop an
algorithm to solve it. A defining table has three sections: input,
processing, and output. To create a defining table, simply draw a table
with the three sections. Then as you read and re-read the problem, put
the parts of the problem into their correct section in the table.</p>

<h4>Template</h4>

<table class="defining"><thead>
	<tr><th colspan="3">Defining Table</th></tr>
	<tr><th>Input</th> <th>Processing</th> <th>Output</th></tr>
</thead><tbody>
	<tr><td>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;</td> <td></td> <td></td></tr>
</tbody></table>

<h4>Example 1</h4>
<p>You have been asked to write a program that will read from the
keyboard the radius of a circle and will output to the monitor the
diameter, circumference, and area of the circle.</p>

<table class="defining"><thead>
	<tr><th colspan="3">Defining Table</th></tr>
	<tr><th>Input</th> <th>Processing</th> <th>Output</th></tr>
</thead><tbody>
	<tr><td>radius</td>
		<td>Compute the diameter: d = 2r<br>
			Compute the circumference: c = 2πr<br>
			Compute the area: a = πr<sup>2</sup></td>
		<td>diameter, circumference, area</td></tr>
</tbody></table>

<div class="pagenum" id="page010">10</div>
<h4>Example 2</h4>
<p>You work for a large construction company. Your boss has asked you to
write a computer program that will read a list of window openings for a
building and compute, and output the total cost of all the windows. The
window openings are entered in inches with the width first and the
height second. The cost of a window is computed by multiplying the area
of the window in square feet by $35.</p>

<table class="defining"><thead>
	<tr><th colspan="3">Defining Table</th></tr>
	<tr><th>Input</th> <th>Processing</th> <th>Output</th></tr>
</thead><tbody>
	<tr><td>A list of window openings<br>For each window
		<ul>
			<li>width in inches</li>
			<li>height in inches</li>
		</ul></td>
		<td>For each window
		<ul>
			<li>compute area in sq. ft.</li>
			<li>multiply area by $35</li>
			<li>add cost of this window to the total cost</li>
		</ul></td>
		<td>total cost of all windows</td></tr>
</tbody></table>

<h3 id="ch2algos">Algorithms</h3>
<p>An <dfn>algorithm</dfn> is simply a list of steps to
perform some task. A recipe is an example of an algorithm because
the recipe lists the steps necessary for preparing some food. Here
is a recipe from
<a target="_blank" href="http://allrecipes.com/recipe/best-chocolate-chip-cookies/">
allrecipes.com</a> for making chocolate chip cookies. Notice that the
directions are what make a recipe similar to an algorithm.</p>
<h4>Ingredients</h4>
<ul>
	<li>1 cup butter, softened</li>
	<li>1 cup white sugar</li>
	<li>1 cup packed brown sugar</li>
	<li>2 eggs</li>
	<li>2 teaspoons vanilla extract</li>
	<li>3 cups all-purpose flour</li>
	<li>1 teaspoon baking soda</li>
	<li>2 teaspoons hot water</li>
	<li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
	<li>2 cups semisweet chocolate chips</li>
	<li>1 cup chopped walnuts</li>
</ul>
<h4>Directions</h4>
<ol>
	<li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
	<li>Cream together the butter, white sugar, and brown sugar until
	smooth.</li>
	<li>Beat in the eggs one at a time.</li>
	<li>Stir in the vanilla.</li>
	<li>Dissolve baking soda in hot water. Add to batter along with
	salt.</li>
	<li>Stir in flour, chocolate chips, and nuts.</li>
	<li>Drop by large spoonfuls onto ungreased pans.</li>
	<li>Bake for about 10 minutes in the preheated oven, or until edges
	are nicely browned.</li>
</ol>

<div class="pagenum" id="page011">11</div>
<h4>Example 3</h4>
<p>Here is a small algorithm for computing the average test score from a
list of test scores. Notice that it is nothing more than the
step-by-step process for performing the calculation. A large computer
program contains many algorithms.</p>
<ol>
	<li>Set <var>sum</var> to 0</li>
	<li>Get the number of students</li>
	<li>For each student
	<ol>
		<li>Get the student’s test score</li>
		<li>Add the student’s score to the <var>sum</var></li>
	</ol></li>
	<li>Divide the <var>sum</var> by the number of students</li>
</ol>

<h4>Example 4</h4>
<p>Write an algorithm to brush your teeth.

<br>
<br></p>

<p>Within the algorithm that you wrote, is the order of the steps
important? Are there any steps that the order does not matter?</p>

<h3 id="ch2progs">Computer Programs</h3>
<p>A computer program is composed of data and instructions. The computer
stores the data temporarily in its main memory. It also stores data more
permanently in files on a hard drive, flash memory, or digital versatile
disk (DVD). The instructions in a computer program are like the steps in
an algorithm. In a programming language like JavaScript, the
instructions are called statements. A single
<dfn id="ch2statement">statement</dfn> is equivalent to a single step in
an algorithm or a single sentence in a paragraph. The statements tell
the computer what to do with the data.</p>

<h3 id="ch2ctrls">Control Structures</h3>
<p>A computer normally executes the statements in a computer program
from top to bottom, or in other words the computer executes the topmost
statement first, the statement below the topmost second, and so on until
the bottommost statement. This order is natural to people from countries
where they read and write text from top to bottom. However, there are
times when a programmer does not want the computer to execute the
statements in a program strictly top to bottom. A <dfn>control
structure</dfn> controls the <em>order in which the computer executes
statements</em>. This order is sometimes called the <dfn>flow of
execution</dfn>. There are five different categories of control
structures as shown in this list:</p>
<dl>
	<dt><dfn>sequence</dfn></dt>
	<dd>causes the computer to execute statements in the order they are
	written in a program, from top to bottom. This is the default
	control structure.</dd>
	<dt><dfn>selection</dfn></dt>
	<dd>causes the computer to select one group of statements to execute
	and another group or groups to skip. This is how a computer
	appears to make decisions.</dd>
	<dt><dfn>repetition</dfn></dt>
	<dd>causes the computer to repeat a group of statements.</dd>
	<dt><dfn>function call</dfn> and <dfn>return</dfn></dt>
	<dd>causes the computer to execute the statements in another
	function and return a result from the other function to the call
	point.</dd>
	<dt><dfn>try</dfn>, <dfn>catch</dfn>, and <dfn>throw</dfn></dt>
	<dd>are used to indicate an error occurred and to handle errors.</dd>
</dl>

<p>You will study, learn, and use the first four of these control
structures in later chapters of this book. Sequence is the default
control structure and is covered in chapters 4 — 12. Selection is
taught in chapters <a target="_blank" href="https://content.byui.edu/file/6145049a-a5ad-413d-86e8-7d784f34e23b/1/textbook.zip/selection.htm">6</a>
and <a target="_blank" href="https://content.byui.edu/file/6145049a-a5ad-413d-86e8-7d784f34e23b/1/textbook.zip/logic.htm">7</a>.
Repetition is taught in <a target="_blank" href="https://content.byui.edu/file/6145049a-a5ad-413d-86e8-7d784f34e23b/1/textbook.zip/repetition.htm">chapter&nbsp;8</a>
and again in <a target="_blank" href="https://content.byui.edu/file/6145049a-a5ad-413d-86e8-7d784f34e23b/1/textbook.zip/arrays.htm">chapter&nbsp;10</a>, and
function call is taught in <a target="_blank" href="https://content.byui.edu/file/6145049a-a5ad-413d-86e8-7d784f34e23b/1/textbook.zip/functions.htm">chapter&nbsp;9</a>.</p>

<h3 id="ch2ops">Computer Operations</h3>
<p>A computer has seven basic operations that it can perform, all of
which we can use when writing algorithms in a computer program. A
computer can do the following:</p>

<ol>
	<li>Receive data (input)<br>
		Input devices: keyboard, mouse, microphone, touch screen,
		temperature sensor, hard drive, flash drive, etc.<br>
		<br></li>
	<li>Write out data (output)<br>
		Output devices: monitor, printer, speakers, lights, hard drive,
		flash drive, etc.<br>
		<br></li>
	<li>Assign a value to a variable or memory location<br>
		<br></li>
	<li>Perform arithmetic<br>
		Operators: −&nbsp;(negation), *&nbsp;(multiplication),
		/&nbsp;(division), %&nbsp;(modulus), +&nbsp;(addition),
		−&nbsp;(subtraction)<br>
		<br></li>
	<li>Compare two values<br>
		Relational operators: &lt;&nbsp;(less than), &lt;=&nbsp;(less
		than or equal), &gt;&nbsp;(greater than), &gt;=&nbsp;(greater
		than or equal), ==&nbsp;(equal), !=&nbsp;(not equal)<br>
		<br></li>
	<li>Repeat a group of actions<br>
		<br></li>
	<li>Call a function and return from that function</li>
</ol>

<p>You will study and use each of these basic computer operations in
later chapters of this text.</p>

<div class="pagenum" id="page013">13</div>
<h3 id="ch2summary">Chapter Summary</h3>
<ul>
	<li>An algorithm is simply a list of steps to accomplish a task.</li>
	<li>Sometimes the order in which the steps of an algorithm are
	performed is very important.</li>
	<li>A defining table is a simple tool to help a programmer
	understand a problem before developing an algorithm to solve the
	problem. A defining table has three sections: input,
	processing, and output.</li>
	<li>A computer program contains both data and instructions. In
	JavaScript, the instructions are called statements.</li>
	<li>The three basic control structures that a programmer uses to
	control the order in which a computer executes statements are
	sequence, selection, and repetition.</li>
	<li>A computer is capable of performing only a few basic operations:
	<ul>
		<li>receive input</li>
		<li>display output</li>
		<li>store data</li>
		<li>perform arithmetic</li>
		<li>compare values</li>
		<li>repeat operations</li>
		<li>call a function</li>
	</ul>
	All high level tasks that a computer can do, such as edit
	photographs, play music, and search data are simply combinations of
	the basic operations.</li>
</ul>
