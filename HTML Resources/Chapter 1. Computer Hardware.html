<h2>Chapter 1. Computer Hardware</h2>

<h3 id="ch1outcomes">Chapter Outcome</h3>
<p>By the end of this chapter, you will have a basic understanding of
computer hardware so that you can begin to program computers.</p>

<h3 id="ch1semi">Semiconductors</h3>
<p>Many of the parts of a computer, including the CPU and main memory,
are composed of millions or billions of microscopic semiconductors that
are etched in silicon. The word semiconductor means these microscopic
parts partially conduct or sometimes conduct electricity. There are many
different types of semiconductors, and each type fulfills a specific
purpose. Below is a list of common semiconductors and their purpose.</p>

	<li>LED – acronym for light emitting diode; a diode that emits
	light when electricity is flowing through it.</li>
	<li>Resistor – a semiconductor that resists the flow of
	electricity. A resistor is often used to protect other parts of a
	computer from surges in electricity.</li>
	<li>Transistor – a semiconductor with two inputs and one
	output called the drain. A small current on the center wire of the
	transistor controls a larger current that flows on the two outer
	wires. A transistor can be used as an amplifier or an automated
	switch with the small electric current input controlling the larger
	input and output current.</li>
	<li>Integrated circuit – a circuit composed of many
	semiconductors (possibly billions) etched on a small piece of
	silicon; sometimes called a computer chip.</li>

<h3 id="ch1parts">Parts of a Computer</h3>
<p>A modern computer is an electronic machine that is composed of two
major parts: hardware and software. Computer hardware is the physical
parts of a computer, such as the keyboard, mouse, CPU, hard drive,
memory, monitor, and printer. An easy mnemonic to help you remember that
hardware is the physical parts of a computer is that the physical parts
are hard. If someone threw a piece of computer hardware at you, and it
hit you, it would hurt. Of course, each part of a computer has its own
specific purpose. Here is a list of common computer hardware parts.</p>

<ol class="term" start="7">
	<li>Power supply – an electric circuit that converts the
	electricity coming from an outlet in the wall, usually 115 volts,
	60-Hertz alternating current (AC), into electricity that a computer
	can use, something like 3.3 volts direct current (DC).</li>
	<li>Keyboard – an input device that allows a user to enter
	data into a computer by pressing keys.</li>
	<li>Motherboard – the main circuit board to which the other
	parts of a computer are attached. Figure&nbsp;1-2 shows a
	motherboard without a CPU, main memory, or other devices attached to
	it.
	<div class="figure" id="figMother">

	<div class="center"><b>Figure 1-2:</b> A computer motherboard.</div>
	</div></li>
	<li>
<div class="pagenum" id="page003">3</div>
	Bus – the wires and integrated circuits that transfer data
	across the motherboard from one component to another.</li>
	<li>BIOS – acronym for basic input and output system; usually
	flash memory installed on the motherboard that contains instructions
	the CPU executes when a computer is started.</li>
	<li><div class="figRight" id="figCPU">
	<img src="./Chapter 1. Computer Hardware_files/corei7.jpg" alt="The top and bottom of an Intel Core i7 CPU." title="The top and bottom of an Intel Core i7 CPU.">
	<div><b>Figure 1-3:</b> The top and bottom of an Intel Core i7 CPU.

	CPU – acronym for central processing unit; a relatively
	large and expensive integrated circuit where most calculations are
	done within a computer.</li>
	<li>Cache – a small amount of fast memory that temporarily
	stores data and instructions and is often located on the CPU. The
	cache contains a partial copy of the contents of main memory so that
	when the CPU needs data for a calculation, the CPU can get the data
	from the cache and does not have to wait for the data to come over a
	bus from main memory. Cache memory is
	<dfn id="ch1volatile">volatile</dfn> which means that when a
	computer is turned off or the electricity is removed, the contents
	of cache are lost.</li>
	<li>Main memory – integrated circuits that temporarily store
	data and instructions for the CPU; sometimes called random access
	memory (RAM). Main memory is volatile which means that when a
	computer is turned off, the contents of main memory are lost.
	<div class="figure" id="figRAM">

	</div>
	Hard drive – stores data semi-permanently usually on a
	spinning platter where microscopic spots have been magnetized to
	store data. A hard drive is
	<dfn id="ch1nonvolatile">non-volatile</dfn> which means that when a
	computer is turned off, the contents of a hard drive are preserved.
	Figure&nbsp;1-5 shows a hard drive with its cover removed to expose
	the platter and the head that moves above the platter and magnetizes
	microscopic spots on the platter.</li>
	<li>CD or DVD drive – reads and writes data semi-permanently
	to a disc using a laser. Compact discs (CD’s) and digital
	versatile disks (DVD’s) are non-volatile.</li>
	<li>Jump, thumb, or flash drive – semi-permanent memory that
	can be read, written, and erased electrically. Jump drive, thumb
	drive, and flash drive are different names for the same type of
	memory device which stores data in flash memory. A solid state hard
	drive does not store data on a platter like a regular hard drive but
	instead stores data in flash memory. Flash memory is non-volatile.</li>
	<li>Monitor – an output device that displays messages, images,
	etc. for a user to see.</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="ch1sizes">Data Sizes</h3>
<p>Each of the following terms is a measure of the amount of data that a
computer can store or process.</p>

<ol class="term" start="19">
	<li>bit – an abbreviation for binary digit. A binary digit is a
	column in a binary number where either 0 or 1 can appear.</li>
	<li>nibble – four bits joined together to form a binary number.
	The name nibble is an inside computing joke because a nibble is half
	of a byte.</li>
	<li>byte – eight bits joined together to form a binary number.</li>
	<li>kilobyte – a true kilobyte is 1024 (2<sup>10</sup>) bytes and
	not just 1000 bytes.</li>
	<li>
<div class="pagenum" id="page005">5</div>
	megabyte – a true megabyte is 1,048,576 (2<sup>20</sup>) bytes

<div><b>Figure 1-6:</b> A graph of a pulsing electric signal showing three
pulses or cycles.</div>
</div>
<p>The clock within a CPU is a small electrical circuit that repeatedly
produces an electric signal that pulses, meaning its voltage rises and
falls similar to <a href="https://content.byui.edu/file/6145049a-a5ad-413d-86e8-7d784f34e23b/1/textbook.zip/hardware.htm#figClock">Figure&nbsp;1-6</a>. This electric
signal pulses many times a second, and a single core on a CPU is
designed to complete one instruction at the end of each pulse. Clock
speed is measured in hertz. A single hertz is one cycle per second. A
cycle is from any point in the pulse to where the pulse repeats. In
other words, a single cycle starts immediately after the electric
voltage falls, includes the voltage rising, and ends when the voltage
falls again. Here are the terms used to measure clock speeds:</p>

<ol class="term" start="28">
	<li>hertz – a unit of frequency equal to one cycle per second</li>
	<li>kilohertz – one thousand cycles per second</li>
	<li>megahertz – one million cycles per second</li>
	<li>gigahertz – one billion cycles per second</li>
</ol>

<p>Many modern computers have clock speeds of 2.5 gigahertz or higher
which means a single core on a CPU is designed to complete 2.5 billion
instructions per second. Many CPU's have multiple cores. Each core
performs calculations independently of the other cores. A quad core CPU
with a clock speed of 2.5 gigahertz is designed to complete 10 billion
<span class="expr">(4 * 2.5 gigahertz)</span>
instructions per second. This is very fast.</p>

<h3 id="ch1classes">Classes of Computers</h3>
<p>Computers can be classified according to their size and primary
purpose. Here are some common computer classes.</p>

<ol class="term" start="32">
	<li>micro or personal computer – a computer designed to be
	used by only one person at a time, such as a smart phone, tablet
	computer, laptop computer, or desktop computer.</li>
	<li>workstation – a powerful computer designed to be used by
	one person at a time and used to perform engineering, scientific,
	and medical tasks such as designing airplane parts.</li>
	<li>mainframe – a very powerful computer designed to be used
	by many people at the same time to perform business or scientific
	tasks.</li>
</ol>

<div class="pagenum" id="page006">6</div>
<h3 id="ch1software">Categories of Software</h3>
<p>Computer hardware is really just a bunch of metal that electricity
can flow through in well-defined paths. Computer hardware will not do
anything without some instructions. The instructions are written by a
computer programmer and are called software. Computer software is simply
a list of instructions that the computer hardware executes. Computer
software can be classified according to its purpose.</p>

<ol class="term" start="35">
	<li>Application – computer software that someone uses to accomplish
	a specific task, such as write a letter, balance an account, watch a
	movie, or play a game. Examples of applications include Microsoft
	Word and Excel, Google Chrome, and iTunes.</li>
	<li>Operating system – computer software that manages the hardware
	and isolates the applications from the hardware so that the
	applications do not have to interact directly with the hardware.
	Examples of computer operating systems include Microsoft Windows,
	Mac OS X, VMS, Linux, HP-UX, and Solaris.</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="ch1char">Character Data</h3>
<p>Everything in a computer’s memory is stored as a number or set
of numbers. Everything. Pictures, songs, text, instructions, everything.
Each character or text symbol is stored in the computer’s memory
as a number. Since the time that electronic computers were invented,
programmers have developed several different coding systems that assign
numbers to characters and symbols. Today there are two coding systems
widely used by programmers: ASCII and Unicode.</p>

<ol class="term" start="37">
	<li id="ch1ascii">ASCII – an acronym for American Standard
	Code for Information Interchange; a coding system (essentially a
	table) with 128 rows that assigns a number to each English letter
	and common punctuation symbol. See
	<a target="_blank" href="http://www.asciitable.com/">asciitable.com</a></li>
	<li id="ch1unicode">Unicode – a very large coding system that
	includes ASCII and assigns a number to symbols from many languages,
	such as English, Portuguese, Greek, Hebrew, Arabic, and Tagalog. See
	<a target="_blank" href="http://unicode.org/">unicode.org</a></li>
</ol>

<div class="pagenum" id="page007">7</div>
<h3 id="ch1exec">Execution Example</h3>
<p>To help you understand how the parts of a computer work together,
consider what happens when a user double clicks on a Microsoft Word
document file (a file with a filename suffix of .docx).</p>
<ol>
	<li>The operating system commands the hard drive to copy the
	Microsoft Word Application (MS Word) into main memory.</li>
	<li>The hard drive copies MS Word over a bus into main memory.</li>
	<li>After MS Word is in main memory, the operating system executes
	MS Word and sends a command to MS Word telling it to open the
	document that the user double clicked.</li>
	<li>MS Word requests the operating system to read the document from
	the hard drive and to place it in main memory.</li>
	<li>The operating system commands the hard drive to copy the
	document file into main memory.</li>
	<li>The hard drive copies the document file over a bus into main
	memory.</li>
	<li>For each character that is in the document
	<ol>
		<li>MS Word reads the character’s Unicode number from main
		memory and requests the operating system to draw that character
		in a window.</li>
		<li>The operating system finds the Unicode number and its
		corresponding symbol in a table and draws the symbol.</li>
	</ol></li>
